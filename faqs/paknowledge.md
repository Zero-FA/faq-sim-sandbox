###### Performance Account (PA) Trading Rules

At Apex, our goal is to support traders with clear, consistent guidelines that help protect your progress and set you up for long-term success. Our trading rules are simple to follow and easy to understand. There’s no long list to memorize, just a few key expectations that help you manage risk and keep your account in good standing.
Contract Scaling Rule
To promote disciplined growth, the Contract Scaling rule outlines how traders manage contract sizes during the growth phase of the account.
Initial Limit: Traders are restricted to trading half of their maximum allowed contracts until they reach the trailing threshold stop.
Threshold Reached: Once the account's End-of-Day (EOD) balance exceeds the trailing threshold (the initial balance + trailing drawdown + $100), traders can then use their full contract limit starting with the next full trading session.
For 100K Static Accounts: Full contracts can be traded after reaching the safety net amount of $2,600.
For full details on the Contract Scaling Rule, please visit the Contract Scaling Rule page.
30% Negative P&L Rule (MAE)
The 30% Negative Profit and Loss (P&L) Rule limits the loss a trader can incur on any single trade, providing a structured approach to risk management. Under this rule, the live, unrealized, open negative P&L cannot exceed 30% of the account's profit balance at the start of the day on a per-trade basis.
This is not a daily loss limit, but a control to prevent excessive loss on any individual trade. At any point, your open negative P&L should not surpass 30% of your start-of-day profit. Regularly monitor your trades and exposure to stay compliant with the rules.
Adjustment Based on Growth: If the end of day (EOD) profit balance doubles the safety net, traders may use a 50% drawdown limit instead of 30% starting with the next full trading session.
For full details on the 30% Negative P&L Rule - Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE) rule, please visit the 30% Negative P&L Rule - Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE) page.
5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule
The 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule is a risk management guideline that ensures your trades are balanced with a responsible amount of risk relative to the potential profit. For every trade you make, your stop loss should not exceed five times the amount of your profit target.
For full details on the 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio rule, please visit the 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio page.
Hedging Rule
No Hedging: Holding both long and short positions simultaneously on the same or correlated instrument is strictly prohibited. This rule ensures that trades are based on strategic analysis rather than speculative attempts to hedge both sides during a news-driven breakout.
For full details on the Hedging rule, please visit the Hedging Rule page.
One Direction Rule (Directionally Biased Trading)
Traders are only allowed to hold a position in one direction at any time—either long (buy) or short (sell). Traders are also prohibited from using a non-directionally biased strategy where they have open orders for both sides of the market
For full details on the One Direction Rule (Directionally Biased Trading), please visit the One Direction Rule (Directionally Biased Trading) rule page.
These rules are designed to create a fair and professional trading environment while keeping the path to payouts straightforward. Review the rules above so you can trade with confidence and stay focused on your growth.

###### PA Payout Parameters

Important Information on Apex Payout Rules and Procedures
At Apex, we make getting paid simple and reliable. Our priority is to process your payouts quickly and accurately so you can enjoy the rewards of your trading. To help make every transaction smooth and hassle-free, here are the key details and reminders you’ll want to know.
Once you request a payout, you can immediately keep trading. You do NOT need to wait to trade until the payout is approved. Just be sure to trade as if the funds were already approved and removed from your balance, keeping in mind minimum thresholds so as not to blow the account.
If you submit a request and then your account balance falls below the minimum required balance to request a payout, it will simply be denied. There is no reason to request to cancel or edit it. 
Payout Split Percentage
Traders are entitled to 100% of the first $25,000 per account they are paid out, and 90% of the profit after that. 
Payout Requirements and Criteria
To request a payout, you must meet the following criteria to ensure smooth and compliant processing. These steps apply to both U.S. and non-U.S. traders.
8 Trading Days: You must have completed at least 8 trading days.
Profit on 5 Days: At least 5 of those 8 days must show a profit of $50 or more.
Safety Net for First Three Payouts: The safety net is calculated as your drawdown limit plus $100. This requirement applies to your first three payouts only. For more details, please refer to Safety Net Rules. 
30% Consistency Rule - Windfall
The 30% Consistency Rule ensures that no single trading day accounts for more than 30% of the total profit balance at the time of a payout request. This rule promotes consistent trading practices and discourages high-risk, erratic trading styles.
Key Details to Note:
Profit Restrictions: If a single trading day generates more than 30% of the profit balance accumulated since the last approved payout, or since the start of trading if no payouts have been made
Reset After Payout: Once a payout is approved, the 30% rule resets and applies only to profits earned after the most recent payout. It does not look back at previous trading periods.
Exceptions: The rule applies until the sixth payout or until the account is transferred to a Live Prop Trading Account. At that point, the 30% rule is no longer in effect.
Easy Calculation Method:
Formula: Highest Profit Day ÷ 0.3 = Minimum Total Profit Required
Example:
On a $50k account, if your highest profit day since your last approved payout (or since you started trading, if this is your first payout request) was $1,500:
Calculation: $1,500 ÷ 0.3 = $5,000
In this situation, to request a payout, you would have to have at least $5,000 in total profit (current balance minus starting balance). If your current total profit is below this minimum, you’ll need to continue trading until you meet this requirement before requesting a payout.
Safety Net Requirement for First Three Payouts
Applies to First Three Payouts Only: The safety net requirement must be observed for the first three approved payouts. As of the fourth payout, the safety net requirement is no longer applicable.
Safety Net Definition: The safety net is defined as the amount equivalent to the drawdown based on the account size, plus an additional $100.
Applies to All Accounts: This rule applies to both new and existing accounts, ensuring consistency for traders as they progress.
Minimum Payout: If the safety net threshold has been met, a payout equal to the minimum allowed amount of $500 can be requested, even if it exceeds the safety net amount.
Payouts Above Minimum:
To request a payout over $500, the balance must exceed the safety net threshold by an amount equal to the additional amount requested.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, we calculate the safety net as $2,500 + $100 = $2,600, based on the drawdown of $2,500. 
A trader with this account reaches a balance of $52,600. The trader can request the minimum payout of $500, leaving the balance at $52,100. This is acceptable, even though it encroaches on the safety net by the $500 allowed.
To request a higher amount, for example, $1,200, the balance must exceed the safety net by the additional amount requested above the minimum of $500. In this case, the additional amount is $700, meaning the account balance must be at least $53,300. Requesting the $1,200 would leave the account balance at $52,100, which is still acceptable since it encroaches on the safety net by no more than the $500 allowed.
Required Minimum Balance to Request a Payout
Your account must meet the required minimum balance to approve a payout, which includes surpassing the trailing drawdown level. The trailing drawdown in a PA account stops at the starting balance plus $100.
Minimum Required Balances:
Account Size	Minimum Required Balance
$25k Account	$26,600
$50k Account	$52,600
$100k Account	$103,100
$150k Account	$155,100
$250k Account	$256,600
$300k Account	$307,600
$100k Static	$102,600
Note: For a $50k account, you cannot request a payout if your balance is $52,000. It must be at least $52,600.
Minimum and Maximum Payout Amounts
Minimum Payout: $500 for any account size. You must have at least eight (8) trading days since the last request and meet the minimum required balance.
Maximum Payouts (First Five Payouts):
Account Size	Maximum Payout
$25k Account	$1,500
$50k Account	$2,000
$100k Account	$2,500
$150k Account	$2,750
$250k Account	$3,000
$300k Account	$3,500
$100k Static	$1,000
No Maximum After Sixth Payout: Starting from the sixth payout, there’s no maximum payout amount, provided the minimum balance threshold remains in the account after the payout.
100% Payout Eligibility Guidelines
To qualify for 100% payouts, traders must first complete five approved payouts. Starting with the sixth payout, you can withdraw 100% of your profits, even if you reach this milestone earlier than four months. By following a steady 8-day payout cycle, you can achieve this in as little as 48 trading days, providing full access to your profits in approximately two months.
Key Highlights:
Eligibility: Complete five approved payouts to access 100% of your profits from the sixth payout onward.
Faster Access: Achieve this in 48 trading days by maintaining an 8-day payout cycle.
Live Prop Accounts: Withdraw profits before the sixth payout if transferred to a Live Prop Account.
Existing Traders: If you’re already receiving 100% payouts or are in your third month, this update does not impact you.
By following these guidelines, you’ll have streamlined and faster access to your earnings, providing you with more control over your profits.
Multiple Accounts and Payouts: Understanding the Benefits
At Apex Trader Funding, each account you manage is treated as a separate, stand-alone account. This allows you to maximize flexibility and opportunity when requesting payouts across multiple accounts.
How Payouts Work with Multiple Accounts
Separate Payouts: Each account operates independently, meaning you can request the maximum payout for each account during every eligible payout period.
Example Scenario:
Suppose you have ten (10) $50,000 accounts:
You can withdraw $2,000 from each account every 8 trading days, for a total of $20,000 across all accounts.
If you repeat this process over 16 trading days, you could withdraw a total of $40,000.
This independence allows you to scale your trading and withdrawals based on your overall account structure.
Benefits of Managing Multiple Accounts
Increased Earning Potential: By leveraging payouts from multiple accounts, you can optimize your income within the same trading periods.
Risk Management: Multiple accounts allow you to diversify your strategies and reduce the impact of losses on any single account.
For more information on why maintaining multiple accounts can be advantageous, check out our detailed guide: Benefits of Managing Multiple Accounts.
By managing multiple accounts responsibly, you can enhance both your trading opportunities and your payout potential.
Prohibited Activities
To maintain integrity and ensure funding is provided only to disciplined and consistent traders, Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits the following activities in Performance Accounts (PA):
Trading Without Risk Management: All trades must have either pending or mental stop losses and a well-defined risk management strategy. Trading without these measures is strictly prohibited.
High-Risk Strategies: Strategies that involve small profit targets while risking disproportionately large amounts are not allowed. For example, setting a five-tick profit target with a 150-tick stop loss demonstrates unacceptable risk management.
Using the Trailing Threshold as a Stop Loss: Traders are prohibited from using the account's full threshold as a stop-loss mechanism to absorb large losses, leading to account liquidation.
Stockpiling Evaluation Accounts: Purchasing multiple discounted evaluation accounts to cycle through and intentionally "blow up" accounts in pursuit of windfall profits is not permitted.
Unsustainable Strategies: Any trading, risk management, or implementation that fails to demonstrate consistent growth and sustainability is prohibited. This includes schemes or behaviors that do not align with responsible trading practices.
Deviating from Professional Standards: Traders must employ strategies and risk management techniques consistent with those they would use in a personally funded account at a registered broker. Apex does not fund traders who deviate from this standard.
Manipulation of the simulated trading environment: Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits manipulation or exploitation of the simulation environment in any way including High Frequency Trading (HFT) or any other exploitative strategies.
Unauthorized Users: Allowing any individual other than the registered owner to access or perform account verification is strictly prohibited. Apex reserves the right to request additional information, including audits and verification procedures, from the account owner to ensure that only the authorized user is trading or accessing the account and to enforce compliance with the contract.
Account and Resource Sharing: Sharing MAC addresses, computers, IPs, credit cards, or trade copying with other traders is strictly forbidden. Violations will result in account closure, forfeiture of funds, and potential additional verification or audits to ensure compliance.
Multiple Account Creation: Creating multiple user accounts is prohibited and is a bannable offense. For more information, please see the following article: Apex Trader Funding Accounts.
Traders engaging in these prohibited activities will forfeit their accounts and all associated balances. Apex reserves the right to audit accounts further if there is a suspicion of non-compliance to guarantee adherence to the trader agreement.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can maintain their accounts in good standing and demonstrate the consistent, disciplined approach Apex seeks to fund.
Probation and Payout Guidelines
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. To navigate this status, please refer to the details provided in the notification email. Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
If the account does not meet the requirements during the probation period, further action may be taken, including denial of payouts, profit removal, and/or account closure.
Remember: Probation is a chance to improve and prove that you can maintain a consistent, responsible trading strategy. By maintaining a consistent, disciplined approach to your trading during probation, you can restore your account to good standing and continue working towards a successful partnership with Apex Trader Funding.

See our full International User Payment Method Set Up page for step-by-step instructions.

Once you request a payout, you can immediately keep trading. You do NOT need to wait to trade until the payout is approved. Just be sure to trade as if the funds were already approved and removed from your balance, keeping in mind minimum thresholds so as not to blow the account.
If you submit a request and then your account balance falls below the minimum required balance to request a payout, it will simply be denied. There is no reason to request to cancel or edit it. 
International Users: For your first payout, you’ll receive an email from Plane after approval with instructions to connect your bank. Be sure to check your spam or junk folder if you don’t see it within a few days.
Receiving Your Funds

###### PA Payout Rules and Payout Method

Important Information on Apex Payout Methods and Procedures
At Apex, we prioritize accurate and timely payouts for all our traders and affiliates. To ensure smooth transactions, it’s crucial to follow the correct procedures when updating your payout method. Below, we’ve outlined key information and important reminders regarding payouts, including updates for non-U.S. traders and affiliates.
Payout Information: How to Request and Receive Your Payment
Apex Trader Funding provides different payout methods based on your location. Whether you're a U.S. or non-U.S. trader, it’s important to follow the correct process to ensure your payout is processed smoothly and accurately.
Payout Method Selection: U.S. vs. Non-U.S. Traders
For U.S. Traders:
Payout Method: Direct Deposit (ACH)
Payment Processing: U.S. traders will have their payments processed via ACH, using regional service providers.
Important ACH Reminder: Ensure you're using the correct ACH routing number for your bank account. ACH routing numbers and Wire Transfer numbers are often different, so verify you're using the correct one.
For Non-U.S. Traders:
Payout Method: International (via Plane)
Payment Processing: Non-U.S. traders will have their payments processed through Plane, a secure payment gateway. After your first request is approved, you will receive an invitation email from Plane to link your local bank. This ensures that subsequent payouts will be processed seamlessly.
Payout Requirements and Criteria
To request a payout, you must meet the following criteria to ensure smooth and compliant processing. These steps apply to both U.S. and non-U.S. traders.
8 Trading Days: You must have completed at least 8 trading days.
Profit on 5 Days: At least 5 of those 8 days must show a profit of $50 or more.
Safety Net for First Three Payouts: The safety net is calculated as your drawdown limit plus $100. This requirement applies to your first three payouts only. For more details, please refer to Safety Net Rules. 
30% Consistency Rule - Windfall
The 30% Consistency Rule ensures that no single trading day accounts for more than 30% of the total profit balance at the time of a payout request. This rule promotes consistent trading practices and discourages high-risk, erratic trading styles.
Key Details to Note:
Profit Restrictions: If a single trading day generates more than 30% of the profit balance accumulated since the last approved payout, or since the start of trading if no payouts have been made
Reset After Payout: Once a payout is approved, the 30% rule resets and applies only to profits earned after the most recent payout. It does not look back at previous trading periods.
Exceptions: The rule applies until the sixth payout or until the account is transferred to a Live Prop Trading Account. At that point, the 30% rule is no longer in effect.
Easy Calculation Method:
Formula: Highest Profit Day ÷ 0.3 = Minimum Total Profit Required
Example:
On a $50k account, if your highest profit day since your last approved payout (or since you started trading, if this is your first payout request) was $1,500:
Calculation: $1,500 ÷ 0.3 = $5,000
In this situation, to request a payout, you would have to have at least $5,000 in total profit (current balance minus starting balance). If your current total profit is below this minimum, you’ll need to continue trading until you meet this requirement before requesting a payout.
Safety Net Requirement for First Three Payouts
Applies to First Three Payouts Only: The safety net requirement must be observed for the first three approved payouts. As of the fourth payout, the safety net requirement is no longer applicable.
Safety Net Definition: The safety net is defined as the amount equivalent to the drawdown based on the account size, plus an additional $100.
Applies to All Accounts: This rule applies to both new and existing accounts, ensuring consistency for traders as they progress.
Minimum Payout: If the safety net threshold has been met, a payout equal to the minimum allowed amount of $500 can be requested, even if it exceeds the safety net amount.
Payouts Above Minimum: 
To request a payout over $500, the balance must exceed the safety net threshold by an amount equal to the additional amount requested.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, we calculate the safety net as $2,500 + $100 = $2,600, based on the drawdown of $2,500. 
A trader with this account reaches a balance of $52,600. The trader can request the minimum payout of $500, leaving the balance at $52,100. This is acceptable, even though it encroaches on the safety net by the $500 allowed.
To request a higher amount, for example, $1,200, the balance must exceed the safety net by the additional amount requested above the minimum of $500. In this case, the additional amount is $700, meaning the account balance must be at least $53,300. Requesting the $1,200 would leave the account balance at $52,100, which is still acceptable since it encroaches on the safety net by no more than the $500 allowed.
Required Minimum Balance to Request a Payout
Your account must meet the required minimum balance to approve a payout, which includes surpassing the trailing drawdown level. The trailing drawdown in a PA account stops at the starting balance plus $100.
Minimum Required Balances:
Account Size	Minimum Required Balance

$50k Account	$52,600

$300k Account	$307,600
$100k Static	$102,600
Note: For a $50k account, you cannot request a payout if your balance is $52,000. It must be at least $52,600.
Minimum and Maximum Payout Amounts
Minimum Payout: $500 for any account size. You must have at least eight (8) trading days since the last request and meet the minimum required balance.
Maximum Payouts (First Five Payouts):
Account Size	Maximum Payout
$25k Account	$1,500
$50k Account	$2,000
$100k Account	$2,500
$150k Account	$2,750
$250k Account	$3,000
$300k Account	$3,500
$100k Static	$1,000
No Maximum After Sixth Payout: Starting from the sixth payout, there’s no maximum payout amount, provided the minimum balance threshold remains in the account after the payout.
100% Payout Eligibility Guidelines
To qualify for 100% payouts, traders must first complete five approved payouts. Starting with the sixth payout, you can withdraw 100% of your profits, even if you reach this milestone earlier than four months. By following a steady 8-day payout cycle, you can achieve this in as little as 48 trading days, providing full access to your profits in approximately two months.

Eligibility: Complete five approved payouts to access 100% of your profits from the sixth payout onward.
Faster Access: Achieve this in 48 trading days by maintaining an 8-day payout cycle.
Live Prop Accounts: Withdraw profits before the sixth payout if transferred to a Live Prop Account.
Existing Traders: If you’re already receiving 100% payouts or are in your third month, this update does not impact you.
By following these guidelines, you’ll have streamlined and faster access to your earnings, providing you with more control over your profits.
Probation and Payout Guidelines
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. To navigate this status, review the details of your probation in your member dashboard: Trader Probation
Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.

How to Set Up Your Payout Method
To ensure smooth processing of your payouts, all traders must correctly set up their payout method in the Apex dashboard. The process is different for U.S. and non-U.S. traders, so follow the appropriate steps below based on your location.
Here’s what you need to do to set up your payout method:
Log in to your Apex dashboard.
Select Payout Method from the available options on your Apex dashboard.
Select International from the dropdown menu for Non-U.S. Traders.
Enter your personal details 
Select Direct Deposit from the dropdown menu for U.S. Traders.
Enter your bank details, including your ACH routing number and bank account number.
Important: Ensure you use the correct ACH routing number and not the wire transfer number.
Enter your payment details (bank information) and save.
For International traders, once you’ve completed these steps, your payout method will be set to International, and you’ll receive an invitation email from Plane to link your local bank account.
Company Payout Requests
For company payouts, fill out the payout form as follows:
First Name field: Enter the company name (e.g., ABC Company LLC).
Please ensure there are no special characters or symbols.
Last Name field: Enter the business owner's first and last name (e.g., John Smith).
How to Ensure Accurate Payout Processing
Matching Bank Country and Primary Residency: The country of your bank account must match your primary country of residency. For example:
If you live in the U.S., your bank account must also be based in the U.S.
If you live outside the U.S., your bank account must match the country where you reside.
Example 1: U.S. Resident
Residency: John Smith resides in Texas, U.S.
Bank Account: John provides the details of his U.S.-based bank account, including the ACH routing number, bank name, and account number.
Status: John’s payout request is approved because his bank country matches his residency, and his details are accurate.
Example 2: Non-U.S. Resident
Residency: Maria Lopez resides in Spain with a valid Spanish work permit.
Bank Account: Maria enters her details in the "International" section of the Payout Method and saves her details.
Status: Maria receives an email from Plane, links her account, and her payout is processed seamlessly.
Example 3: Mismatched Details
Residency: James Brown resides in Canada but lists a U.S.-based bank account.
Issue: The payout is rejected because the bank account country does not match his residency.
Resolution: James updates his details in the "International" section of the Payout Method and saves his details, and his request is approved.
Accuracy is Key: Make sure all information on your payout form is correct. Incorrect or incomplete details will result in delays or the rejection of your payout request. Ensure your ACH details are accurate before submitting your request.
How to Request Your Payout
To request your payout from Apex Trader Funding, follow these simple steps to ensure everything goes smoothly. Whether it’s your first time or you’ve requested payouts before, this process is quick and easy. Just make sure all the details are correct so we can get your payout processed without delay!
Log in to Your Apex Dashboard
First, head over to the Apex Trader Funding Dashboard. Use your login credentials to access your account.
Navigate to Payout Request
Once you're in your dashboard, look to the left-hand menu. You’ll see an option labeled Payout Request. Go ahead and click on it to start the process.
Follow the Prompts
After clicking on Payout Request, you'll be guided through a series of prompts. These are simple steps where you’ll enter details about your payout. Double-check everything—make sure the information matches your trading account and that there are no errors. Accuracy is key to ensuring your payout is processed without any issues.
Submit Your Request
Once you’ve reviewed everything and are confident the details are correct, go ahead and submit your payout request. That’s it! You're done!
What Happens Next?
Confirmation Email:
After submitting your payout request, the relevant department will review it to make sure everything is in order. Once it’s approved, you’ll receive a confirmation email confirming your request.
Check Your Spam or Junk Folder:
If you don’t see the confirmation email right away, don’t panic. Sometimes emails end up in your spam or junk folder. Be sure to check there if you can’t find it in your inbox.
Payout Request Processing and Timeline
Once you submit your payout request, it will undergo a structured review, approval, and transfer process. Below is a detailed explanation of each step to help you understand the timeline and what to expect during the payout process.
Payout Request Submission and Review: Once you submit your payout request, it will be reviewed and either approved or denied within 2 business days, depending on the demand and any holidays. During peak periods, the review time may vary slightly.
If your payout is denied, you’ll be informed of the reasons for the denial, and you can make the necessary adjustments for future payout requests.
Funds Transfer Initiation:  After your payout is approved, the funds will be transferred to your selected payout method. The funds transfer will generally be initiated within 3-4 business days after approval. The processing time for transferring the funds depends on the payment method you’ve selected.
For U.S. traders, this is typically ACH (Automated Clearing House), and the funds will be transferred to your U.S. bank account.
For non-U.S. traders, payments are processed via Plane (a payment gateway), and additional steps will be involved (detailed below).
Funds Arrival: After the transfer is initiated, it can take an additional 3-7 business days for the funds to appear in your bank account, depending on your bank’s processing time. Banks may take varying amounts of time to process and reflect the incoming payment, so it’s essential to check with your bank for specific timing.
International Payments via Plane: For non-U.S. traders, once your payout request is approved, you will receive an invitation email from Plane, typically within 1-4 business days, depending on the volume of requests. Follow the instructions in the email to link your bank account. 
Be sure to check your spam or junk folders in case the invitation email ends up there.
After linking your account, Plane will process the payment, which usually takes 3-7 business days for completion.
Important Reminders:
Do NOT Submit Help Desk Tickets Immediately After Payout Request:
Please do not submit a Help Desk ticket immediately after updating your payout method or once your payout request is approved. Invitation emails are sent at different points during the processing period, not immediately.
Payment Status – PAID:
Once your payout is marked as PAID in the system, it means the funds have been successfully sent to your Plane account (for non-U.S. traders) or your bank account (for U.S. traders). The funds will be available once processing is complete.

What are the Consistency Rules for PA and Live Accounts?
THIS PAGE HAS UPDATED DETAILED INFORMATION ON RECENT CLARIFICATIONS OF RULES

 

PA and Live Funded Accounts
At Apex Trader Funding, we believe that responsible, disciplined trading is the key to long-term success. Our consistency rules for PA and Live accounts are designed to help you build a sustainable and successful trading career. These rules are not just about limitations; they are about creating a strong foundation for you to grow and thrive as a trader.

Violating these rules can result in denied payouts and even account closure, so it's essential to understand and follow them carefully. Let’s break down what Apex expects from its traders and how you can maintain compliance.

A Long-Term Relationship with Apex
When you trade with Apex, we see it as a partnership. We want to fund consistent, reliable traders who are committed to growing their accounts over time. Apex is more than just a funding provider—we’re here to support your journey and help you develop a strategy that works for you.

We value traders who treat trading as a profession, not a gamble. By adhering to our consistency rules, you’re showing that you’re ready for a long-term relationship—one where you can grow your account and increase your profitability in a sustainable way.

 
Evaluation Accounts vs. PA/Live Accounts
For more information on Evaluation Accounts, please see the EVALUATION RULES PAGE

Evaluation Accounts: There are no consistency rules during this phase, which is focused on meeting profit goals and overcoming the Trailing Drawdown.
PA and Live Accounts: Have specific consistency rules. Violating these rules could result in denied payouts or account closure.
By successfully navigating the evaluation phase, you set yourself up for the next stage, where you can move towards a funded account with a more structured trading approach.

Are Performance Accounts (PA) Live?
Performance Accounts (PAs) begin as simulated (SIM) accounts, but they use live market data to replicate real trading conditions. While these accounts are initially simulated, traders are paid just as they would be with a live account.

Starting with a SIM account offers advantages for both traders and the company. Trading can be unpredictable, and many traders may struggle to maintain their accounts in the early stages. Using SIM accounts initially provides a safety net, reducing the risk for both parties while still ensuring a realistic trading experience.

Transitioning to Live Accounts
When a trader demonstrates consistent performance in their SIM account, the trades are mirrored in a live account through an Application Programming Interface (API). This allows traders to continue refining their strategies while their success is evaluated in real-time market conditions.

Once long-term consistency is confirmed, the trader will be contacted regarding a transition to a live account. At this stage, the trader is directly engaging with live markets, and their account is no longer simulated. This process is directly communicated to the traders considered for Live Accounts. 

The Help Desk has no further information regarding hypothetical questions about Live Accounts. You will be contacted when considered. Do not submit tickets regarding this.

Key Terms:

SIM (Simulated): A practice account that replicates live market data but does not involve actual money or live trades.
API (Application Programming Interface): A tool that connects systems, enabling trades from a SIM account to be mirrored in a live account.
By taking this step-by-step approach, Performance Accounts (PAs) strike a balance between providing traders an opportunity to prove themselves and ensuring responsible risk management.

Trailing Drawdown Rule
In a Performance Account, the trailing drawdown starts at the liquidation threshold, which is determined by your plan's max drawdown amount. As your account balance increases, the trailing drawdown follows your peak unrealized balance until it reaches a fixed point, which is called the Safety Net (initial balance + drawdown limit + $100). The trailing drawdown stops moving when your peak unrealized account balance reaches the Safety Net. For a reminder on how the Trailing Drawdown Threshold works, click here.

Example; 

A $50,000 account has a safety net of $52,600, which is the $2500 drawdown plus $100.

A $150,000 account has a safety net of $155,100, which is the $5000 drawdown plus $100.

If you have $6000 profit for both accounts, the drawdown threshold will still be fixed at the starting balance plus $100.



Contract Scaling Rule
To promote disciplined growth, the Contract Scaling rule outlines how traders manage contract sizes during the growth phase of the account.

Initial Limit: Traders are restricted to trading half of their maximum allowed contracts until they reach the trailing threshold stop.
Threshold Reached: Once the account's End-of-Day (EOD) balance exceeds the trailing threshold (the initial balance + trailing drawdown + $100), traders can then use their full contract limit starting with the next full trading session.
For 100K Static Accounts: Full contracts can be traded after reaching the safety net amount of $2,600.
For example, on a $50,000 Performance Account (PA) with a maximum of 10 contracts, traders can initially trade up to 5 contracts. When the account EOD balance reaches $52,600 ($50,000 initial balance + $2,500 trailing drawdown + $100 buffer), the trailing stop no longer applies, and traders can trade the full 10 contracts.

Once the trailing threshold is reached, traders can continue using the full contract limit even if the account balance drops below the threshold.

Single Violation Penalty: If more than half of the maximum allowed contracts are accidentally traded, traders are expected to close out the excessive contracts immediately. Failure to do so may result in the payout request being denied and the account being reset to the EOD balance from the previous trading day, which is the day before the first scaling rule violation occurred.

The trader would then need to complete 8 additional compliant trading days before becoming eligible to request another payout.

Consistent Violation Penalty: Blatant or repeated violations of the scaling rule will result in account closure and forfeiture of all balances.

30% Negative P&L Rule - Maximum Adverse Excursion (MAE)
The 30% Negative Profit and Loss (P&L) Rule limits the loss a trader can incur on any single trade, providing a structured approach to risk management. Under this rule, the live, unrealized, open negative P&L cannot exceed 30% of the account's profit balance at the start of the day on a per-trade basis.

This is not a daily loss limit, but a control to prevent excessive loss on any individual trade. At any point, your open negative P&L should not surpass 30% of your start-of-day profit. Regularly monitor your trades and exposure to stay compliant with the rules.

Limit on Losses: Open trades should not exceed a 30% negative drawdown from the account’s profit balance.

Example: For a $50,000 account, if the profit balance is $4,000, a trader should not allow a drawdown exceeding $1,200.

New/Low Profit Accounts: For accounts that are new or have low profits, the 30% rule is based on the trailing threshold (e.g., 30% of $2,500 on a $50,000 account would be $750).

Adjustment Based on Growth: If the end-of-day (EOD) profit balance doubles the safety net, traders may use a 50% drawdown limit instead of 30% starting with the next full trading session.

Example:

For a $50,000 account, if you accumulate $2,600 in profit and pass the safety net, your risk is calculated based on 30% of that $2,600. If your profits rise to $5,200, your drawdown allowance can increase to $2,600 (50% of $5,200).

 



At Apex Trader Funding, responsible trading is at the core of our practices, and managing drawdowns is a crucial part of that. Here’s what you need to know:

Continuous Monitoring: We encourage you to regularly monitor your trades and adjust your positions as needed to stay within these limits. If your drawdown approaches 30%, consider closing or adjusting your trades to avoid breaching the limit. Quick adjustments can help prevent any compliance issues.
Temporary Exceedances: If your drawdown momentarily exceeds 30% but you act quickly to manage the situation, there won’t be an automatic penalty. However, repeated or significant breaches could lead to warnings or account restrictions.
Adhering to these guidelines can ensure that your trading strategy remains robust and sustainable. These terms should be strictly followed to ensure consistent compliance with Apex's 30% negative P&L rule.

Static Accounts

The 30% Negative P&L rule for Static Accounts is designed to help manage risk by ensuring that losses are kept within safe limits. The rule applies in two stages: one when the account balance is below the safety net, and another when it exceeds the safety net.

Below the Safety Net ($2,600): When the account balance is below the $2,600 safety net, the maximum loss per trade is $187.50. This is 30% of the fixed $625 drawdown that applies to accounts at this stage. Essentially, until the balance surpasses the safety net, the rule restricts your loss on any single trade to $187.50.
Above the Safety Net ($2,600): Once the account balance exceeds $2,600, the 30% Negative P&L rule is recalculated based on the current profit balance in the account. For example, if your account reaches $103,000, which includes a $3,000 profit, the maximum allowable loss per trade is $900 (30% of the $3,000 profit).
30% Consistency Rule - Windfall
The 30% Consistency Rule ensures that no single trading day accounts for more than 30% of the total profit balance at the time of a payout request. This rule promotes consistent trading practices and discourages high-risk, erratic trading styles.
Key Details to Note:
Profit Restrictions: If a single trading day generates more than 30% of the profit balance accumulated since the last approved payout, or since the start of trading if no payouts have been made
Reset After Payout: Once a payout is approved, the 30% rule resets and applies only to profits earned after the most recent payout. It does not look back at previous trading periods.
Exceptions: The rule applies until the sixth payout or until the account is transferred to a Live Prop Trading Account. At that point, the 30% rule is no longer in effect.
Easy Calculation Method:
Formula: Highest Profit Day ÷ 0.3 = Minimum Total Profit Required
Example:
On a $50k account, if your highest profit day since your last approved payout (or since you started trading, if this is your first payout request) was $1,500:
Calculation: $1,500 ÷ 0.3 = $5,000
In this situation, to request a payout, you would have to have at least $5,000 in total profit (current balance minus starting balance). If your current total profit is below this minimum, you’ll need to continue trading until you meet this requirement before requesting a payout.
Risk Management, Stop Losses, Profit Targets, Trailing
Apex Trader Funding provides traders with an opportunity to demonstrate disciplined risk management and effective trading strategies. Proper risk management is not just encouraged but is mandatory for all accounts, ensuring that trading is conducted responsibly and without speculative or reckless behavior.
5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule
The 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule is a risk management guideline that ensures your trades are balanced with a responsible amount of risk relative to the potential profit. For every trade you make, your stop loss should not exceed five times the amount of your profit target.
For example:
If your profit target is 10 ticks, your maximum stop loss should be 50 ticks (5 times your profit target).
If you set a stop loss beyond 50 ticks, such as 100 ticks, this would violate the rule.
Following the 5:1 rule helps you manage risk by ensuring that you are not taking excessive losses relative to your target profits. This helps protect your account balance and encourages more disciplined trading over time. It also promotes a strategy where your potential rewards are always greater than the risks you are taking on each trade. By following the 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio, you maintain a disciplined trading approach that supports long-term success and helps you manage risk effectively.
Stop Losses and Risk Management
Stop Losses Are Required: Trading without a stop loss or relying solely on the Trailing Threshold to manage risk is strictly prohibited. Every trade must have a pre-defined risk level, either through manual stop-loss orders or a mental plan that adheres to your strategy. Letting an account "blow out" by hitting the Trailing Threshold is not acceptable.
Risk-to-Reward Ratios: Apex enforces a maximum risk-to-reward ratio of 5:1. For instance, if your profit target is 10 ticks, your stop loss should not exceed 50 ticks. Similarly, if your goal is to make $100 in profit, the stop loss should not risk more than $500. This ensures responsible trading and prevents excessive risk on trades.
Prohibited Practices: Strategies that involve “all-in” trades with maximum contract sizes, particularly at the start of a PA account, to quickly overcome the trailing drawdown are prohibited. These windfall or gambling approaches violate Apex’s standards and may result in forfeiture of accounts or payouts.
Proper Use of Stop Losses and Profit Targets 
Planned Exits for Both Losses and Profits: Before initiating any trade, traders must have a clear plan for managing both risk and profit targets. Stop losses, profit targets, and trailing stops should align with the strategy's historical performance and back-tested data.
Trailing Stops for Profit Protection: As the market moves in your favor, trailing stops should be used to secure gains while allowing profits to run during trends. However, stops should not be moved backward to increase risk and potentially violate the drawdown rules. Adjusting stops forward to protect profits is a key aspect of effective risk management.
ATM Strategies for Automation: Apex encourages the use of ATM (Advanced Trade Management) strategies, which automate stop-loss and profit-target levels. These can be adjusted during trades to protect profits while adapting to market conditions.
Mental Stops Are Permitted: Traders familiar with their strategy may use mental stops instead of placing hard stop-loss orders. However, mental stops must still be honored. For traders on Probation, hard stop-loss levels are mandatory.
Trending and Long-Term Strategies: In trending or longer-term strategies where specific profit targets may not be clear, the initial stop loss becomes especially important. It defines the maximum risk, allowing the trade to be managed responsibly, even in volatile conditions.
Payout Evaluation Requirements
During the eight-day evaluation period, traders must demonstrate consistency by achieving a profit of at least $50 on five different trading days. Strategies such as "flipping" trades—closing and re-entering positions to adjust to market conditions—are allowed as long as they align with a structured plan and meet the $50 minimum profit requirement on eligible days.
Consistency and Discipline
Apex requires traders to demonstrate consistent and disciplined trading. Risk management strategies should avoid speculative windfall approaches, such as:
Entering large contract positions at the start of a PA account in an attempt to quickly overcome the trailing drawdown.
Using the Trailing Threshold limit to manage risk without applying proper stop-loss strategies.
Traders are expected to maintain consistent trade management practices, adhering to their system's guidelines for stop losses, profit targets, and risk-to-reward ratios.
Risk management is the cornerstone of successful trading. Every trade must include a defined risk level, a clear exit strategy for both profit and loss, and adherence to the 5:1 maximum risk-to-reward ratio. Reckless trading practices—such as speculative “all-in” trades, adjusting stops to increase risk, or relying solely on the Trailing Threshold to manage risk—are prohibited. By implementing a systematic and disciplined approach, traders can achieve consistent results while protecting their accounts and advancing toward Live Prop Trading Accounts.
Max Contracts Rule
The Max Contracts Rule ensures traders adhere to the defined contract limits for their account and discourages any attempts to abuse or circumvent these limits.
Key Guidelines:
Traders must not exceed the maximum contract limit set for their account at any time.
Attempts to bypass the limit through combined instruments or micro contracts are prohibited.
Examples of Violations:
Trading the maximum contracts on multiple instruments simultaneously (e.g., 10 contracts on ES and 10 on YM for a 10-contract limit account).
Exceeding the maximum contract limit directly (e.g., trading 20 contracts on a 10-contract limit account).
Using micro contracts in a way that circumvents the maximum contract rule (e.g., excessively trading micro contracts to replicate full contract exposure).
Violations or attempts to abuse the max contracts rule will result in the termination of the account without a refund or payout. Traders are expected to respect these limits to maintain account compliance and avoid penalties.
By adhering to the Max Contracts Rule, traders can ensure they remain in good standing while fostering disciplined trading practices.
Contract Size Consistency Rule
Maintaining a consistent approach to contract sizes is essential for demonstrating disciplined and professional trading behavior. While the rules allow flexibility for strategic adjustments, erratic or manipulative changes in contract sizes are strictly prohibited.
Key Guidelines:
Consistent Strategy: Traders must use contract sizes that reflect a consistent trading approach. Adjustments based on market conditions, such as reducing size during high volatility or increasing size as the account balance grows, are acceptable as long as they align with a systematic strategy.
Example: Starting with 2 contracts and scaling up as profits increase is consistent. Conversely, trading 10 contracts one day and dropping to 2 contracts the next solely to secure a payout is not.
Scaling with Growth: As the account balance grows and the cushion increases, contract sizes should scale proportionally. This reflects disciplined account management and responsible risk-taking.
Example: A growing balance justifies a steady increase in contract sizes. Reducing contract sizes despite growth out of fear of losing profit before a withdrawal is considered a lack of discipline and an invalid strategy.
Responsible Adjustments for Losses: If the account balance decreases due to losses, it is reasonable and responsible to reduce contract sizes to manage risk. Similarly, after a withdrawal reduces the account balance, trading smaller sizes is prudent until growth resumes.
Prohibited Practices:
It is not allowed to use large contract sizes early in a PA Account to chase lucky trades or recover losses, followed by a sudden reduction in size.
Cycling through multiple PA Accounts by starting with substantial sizes, losing the balance, and resetting accounts to repeat this behavior is considered manipulative and is grounds for account termination.
Making drastic, inconsistent changes in contract size solely to manipulate payouts or the evaluation process will result in forfeiture of payouts and, potentially, probation status.
Expectations for Payout Eligibility:
Traders must maintain consistent trading behavior throughout the account's lifecycle, from inception to payout. This includes using the same contracts, sizes, and targets unless modifications are made logically due to account growth or loss.
To demonstrate profit stability, traders may be required to trade consistently for eight days with uniform contract sizes before becoming eligible for a payout request.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can ensure their trading approach reflects professionalism and discipline. Apex is committed to funding responsible traders, not those engaging in high-risk, erratic, or manipulative practices. Consistency is key to maintaining account compliance and securing payouts.
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Rule
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) involves entering additional trades in the same direction as the original order, even if the market moves against the trader’s position. As the market moves contrary to the trade, the trader continues to add more entries in the same direction.
Key Guidelines:
Permitted Use: DCA is allowed under this agreement with no restrictions on contract size for additional entries.
No Entry Restrictions: There are no specific rules for determining entry points, timeframes, or distances from the original order.
Risk Management: Traders must maintain responsible risk-to-reward ratios when using DCA.
Compliance with Consistency Rules: DCA is acceptable as long as it does not violate other consistency rules, such as the 30% profit in a day rule or the 30% negative P&L rule.
Responsible Application: Traders are expected to apply DCA consistently and responsibly to adhere to these rules and avoid potential issues.
By following these guidelines, traders can effectively utilize DCA while adhering to the account’s rules and risk management framework.
Adding to Trades
Traders may add to their trades as the market moves in their favor, following a defined trading strategy or system rules. For example, if a trader enters a long position and the market moves positively, they may add additional long contracts to capitalize on the trend.
Key Guidelines:
Strategic Entries: Traders are permitted to scale into winning trades in PA Accounts, using larger contract sizes if supported by their strategy.
Directional Bias: All additions must align with a clear directional bias and follow a consistent, defined strategy. Random or reckless entries in hopes of a market turnaround are not allowed.
Acceptable Scaling: Adding contracts to a profitable trade as part of a structured approach is acceptable and encouraged for disciplined trading.
Prohibited Practices: Entering large contract sizes at the outset without a clear strategy or placing trades purely in anticipation of a market reversal is prohibited.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can effectively scale into profitable trades while maintaining consistency and professionalism in their trading approach.
Safety Net Requirement Rule
Applies to First Three Payouts Only: The safety net requirement must be observed for the first three approved payouts. As of the fourth payout, the safety net requirement is no longer applicable.
Safety Net Definition: The safety net is defined as the amount equivalent to the drawdown based on the account size plus an additional $100.
Applies to All Accounts: This rule applies to both new and existing accounts, ensuring consistency for traders as they progress.
Minimum Payout: If you have reached the safety net threshold, you can request a payout of at least $500, even if it exceeds the safety net amount.
Payouts Above Minimum: 
To request a payout over $500, the balance must exceed the safety net threshold by an amount equal to the additional amount requested.
Example:
For a $50,000 account, the drawdown is $2,500, so the safety net is calculated as $2,500 + $100 = $2,600. 
A trader with this account reaches a balance of $52,600. The trader can request the minimum payout of $500, leaving the balance at $52,100. This is acceptable, even though it encroaches on the safety net by the $500 allowed.
To request a higher amount, for example, $1,200, the balance must exceed the safety net by the additional amount requested above the minimum of $500. In this case, the additional amount is $700, meaning the account balance must be at least $53,300. Requesting the $1,200 would leave the account balance at $52,100, which is still acceptable since it encroaches on the safety net by no more than the $500 allowed.
Flipping Trades Rule
Flipping is Allowed at Apex Trader Funding, but it must be done strategically and within the guidelines. Flipping refers to opening and closing trades quickly within the same day. While this is allowed, it must meet certain criteria to count toward your trading goals. Here's what you need to know about the Flipping Trades Rule.
Conditions for Flipping:
Minimum Profit Requirement:
To count towards your trading day, you must achieve a minimum profit of $50 per day from the flipped trades. This ensures that flipping is done with a goal of steady profitability, rather than just making quick trades for the sake of meeting minimum activity.
Consistent Performance:
You must flip trades for at least 5 trading days to meet the eligibility criteria for consistent trading performance. This means that on each of those days, you need to hit the $50 profit target.
Example of Flipping Trades:
Day 1: A trader opens and closes several quick trades throughout the day, earning a $60 profit. Since this exceeds the $50 minimum, this day counts toward the 5-day trading goal.
Day 2 to Day 5: The same trader repeats the process over the next four days, earning a profit of at least $50 each day. This results in meeting the 5-day trading consistency requirement.
One-Direction Rule (Directionally biased trading)
Single Direction Rule: Traders are only allowed to hold a position in one direction at any time—either long (buy) or short (sell). Traders are also prohibited from using a non-directionally biased strategy where they have open orders for both sides of the market
No Hedging: Holding both long and short positions simultaneously on the same or correlated instrument is strictly prohibited. This rule ensures that trades are based on strategic analysis rather than speculative attempts to hedge both sides during a news-driven breakout.
News Trading Rule
Apex Trader Funding allows traders to engage in news trading during significant market events, where rapid price movements can present profitable opportunities. 
Automation in Trading
At Apex Trader Funding, the use of automation is strictly prohibited on PA and Live accounts. This includes any form of AI (Artificial Intelligence), Autobots, algorithms, fully automated trading systems, and high-frequency trading (HFTs). These types of systems that trade without active human intervention are not allowed.
Any type of hands-off, set-and-forget, or set-and-walk-away trading, including systems that run continuously 24 hours a day, is strictly prohibited. Using these types of automation will result in the immediate closure of your PA or Live account and the forfeiture of all funds and balances.
Semi-automated software can be used, but it must be actively monitored by the trader at all times. This means the trader must be present and actively managing the trades, making adjustments based on market conditions, news events, and other factors. The software should assist in executing trades based on predefined rules, but the trader must remain in control, overseeing every aspect of the trading process.
It’s also advised to turn off or pause the semi-automated software when market conditions aren’t ideal, or when a trade setup isn’t clear. The purpose of this software is to assist with the speed and accuracy of placing trades—not to act as a fully automated system that trades on its own.
By following these guidelines, you ensure that you remain in full control of your trades, using automation responsibly to enhance your trading process without replacing the trader's judgment.
Please note that the results from the use of any trade copiers or external programs are the sole responsibility of the trader listed on the account. Apex Trader Funding reserves the right to take action should there be any rule violations resulting from the use of these programs. 
Hedging and Correlated Instruments Rule
Traders shall not trade one direction on minis and another direction on micros at the same time. Traders shall not spread trade indices, i.e., long ES, and short YM. All Apex accounts must be traded directionally only and never be both long and short concurrently in the same account or in other accounts in any correlated markets. This includes all indices, metals, grains, currencies, or any correlating instrument, no matter the size, i.e., micro, mini, etc. For example, the trader cannot be short NQ and Long ES under any circumstance.
Copy or Trading Services Operations or Participation
Performance Accounts (PA) and Live Prop Accounts must be traded exclusively by the individual listed on the account. Under no circumstances can these accounts be managed or influenced by any other party, person, system, automated trading bot, copy trading service, or trade mirroring software.
Failure to comply with this rule constitutes an immediate breach of contract and will result in the closure of all associated user accounts. Traders are required to maintain sole responsibility for all trading activity within their accounts to ensure compliance with Apex’s standards.
Defined System with Set Rules
At Apex Trader Funding, having a defined trading strategy with clear rules is essential for success. Traders are required to establish a system that includes set guidelines for entries, stops, targets, and trailing stops, and must follow these rules consistently and with discipline. This approach is designed to foster steady, sustainable trading, not speculative or erratic behavior.
What is a Defined System?
Traders must have a systematic approach to their trading that can be explained and tracked. The system should include:
Set Rules for every trade (entry points, stop losses, profit targets, and trailing stops).
A normal day-to-day system that can be consistently applied across multiple trading sessions.
Clear, trackable performance that can be explained if requested, ensuring transparency.
This systematic approach is critical for ensuring that the trader’s decisions are based on strategy, not emotion or random actions.
What Apex Doesn’t Want
Apex is not looking for traders who gamble with their accounts or aim for "lottery-style lucky windfalls." Traders who blow through multiple accounts in pursuit of big, unpredictable profits do not demonstrate the consistency and discipline Apex values. Think of it this way: If you were funding a trader, would you feel comfortable with someone who consistently takes reckless risks without a structured approach?
Review Process for Compliance
Apex reserves the right to request a detailed explanation of your trading system, including:
Marked-up charts of trades you’ve executed, as evidence of consistent rule adherence.
A live Zoom session to observe and confirm that you’re following your strategy during actual trading sessions.
Recordings of your trading sessions to review your system’s consistency, including explanations of your entries and exits.
Documentation showing the tools, indicators, platforms, and contract sizes used during your trading sessions.
Apex will use these materials to assess whether your trading strategy is consistent and aligned with the rules you’ve set. This process ensures that you’re adhering to a defined system and not relying on random or speculative actions.
Directional Bias and Consistency
Apex only approves directional trading strategies, where there is a clear bias for the trade. This means you should always have a predetermined direction and bias based on your system and not execute trades without this clarity. Traders are not allowed to place:
Bracket orders in both directions without a clear directional bias (e.g., long limit order and short limit order placed in anticipation of a breakout).
Trading strategies that involve chasing market movements or seeking windfall profits without a systematic approach.
This type of non-systematic trading, where trades are placed without a clear direction or rationale, is often a sign of a trader who does not have a defined strategy and is instead speculating on market moves. Apex does not tolerate this behavior.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
Any funds earned during periods of non-compliance or from trades that do not align with the approved system will be deducted from the account. This is in line with the PA Consistency guidelines outlined in the FAQ section and the video series on the Apex Trader Funding website.
Prohibited Activities
To maintain integrity and ensure funding is provided only to disciplined and consistent traders, Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits the following activities in Performance Accounts (PA):
Trading With Risk Management: All trades must have either pending or mental stop losses and a well-defined risk management strategy. Trading without these measures is strictly prohibited.
High-Risk Strategies: Strategies that involve small profit targets while risking disproportionately large amounts are not allowed. For example, setting a five-tick profit target with a 150-tick stop loss demonstrates unacceptable risk management.
Using the Trailing Threshold as a Stop Loss: Traders are prohibited from using the account's full threshold as a stop-loss mechanism to absorb large losses, leading to account liquidation.
Stockpiling Evaluation Accounts: Purchasing multiple discounted evaluation accounts to cycle through and intentionally "blow up" accounts in pursuit of windfall profits is not permitted.
Unsustainable Strategies: Any trading, risk management, or implementation that fails to demonstrate consistent growth and sustainability is prohibited. This includes schemes or behaviors that do not align with responsible trading practices.
Deviating from Professional Standards: Traders must employ strategies and risk management techniques consistent with those they would use in a personally funded account at a registered broker. Apex does not fund traders who deviate from this standard.
Manipulation of the simulated trading environment: Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits manipulation or exploitation of the simulation environment in any way including High Frequency Trading (HFT) or any other exploitative strategies.
Unauthorized Users: Allowing any individual other than the registered owner to access or perform account verification is strictly prohibited. Apex reserves the right to request additional information — including audits and verification procedures — from the account owner to ensure that only the authorized user is trading or accessing the account and to enforce compliance with the contract.
Account and Resource Sharing: Sharing MAC addresses, computers, IPs, credit cards, or trade copying with other traders is strictly forbidden. Violations will result in account closure, forfeiture of funds, and potential additional verification or audits to ensure compliance.
Multiple Account Creation: Creating multiple user accounts is prohibited and is a bannable offense. For more information, please see the following article: Apex Trader Funding Accounts .
Traders engaging in these prohibited activities will forfeit their accounts and all associated balances. Apex reserves the right to audit accounts further if there is a suspicion of non-compliance to guarantee adherence to the trader agreement.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can maintain their accounts in good standing and demonstrate the consistent, disciplined approach Apex seeks to fund.
Account Probation Status
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. For more information, please refer to the details provided in the notification email. Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.
Consequences of Non-Compliance
If the account does not meet the requirements during the probation period, further action may be taken, including denial of payouts, profit removal, and/or account closure.
Remember: Probation is a chance to improve and prove that you can maintain a consistent, responsible trading strategy. By maintaining a consistent, disciplined approach to your trading during probation, you can restore your account to good standing and continue working towards a successful partnership with Apex Trader Funding.
Summary of Core Trading Rules
Use a Genuine Trading Strategy: Traders must employ a consistent, real-world trading strategy that aligns with live market conditions.
DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is Allowed: DCA is permitted as long as it does not violate any other consistency rules (i.e. 30% profit in a day, 30% negative P&L, etc.).  DCA needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Flipping Trades is Allowed: Opening and closing trades quickly to count as a trading day is permitted, as long as the $50 minimum profit for 5 days is satisfied.
News Trading is Allowed (with Restrictions):
Trading based on news events is permitted; however, traders cannot take opposing positions (e.g., long and short) on the same news event.
News trading is permitted as long as it does not violate any other consistency rules (i.e. 30% profit in a day, 30% negative P&L, etc.). 
News trading needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Trade Half Contracts Until Trailing Stop is Achieved: Traders are limited to trading half of the available contracts until they meet the trailing stop threshold, encouraging careful risk management.
Maintain a 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio on Trades: Ensure a maximum 5:1 risk-to-reward ratio on all trades. For instance, if targeting a profit of 10 ticks, the stop loss should not exceed 50 ticks.
Observe the 30% Negative P&L Limit (Adjustable to 50%):
Maintain a 30% drawdown limit based on the account’s profit balance. As the account grows, this limit may be adjusted to 50%, providing more flexibility as the account becomes more established.
Example: A trader starts with a 30% drawdown limit, which can be raised to 50% once their account balance meets specified growth conditions.
Practical Example: A trader adhering to a defined, consistent strategy, observing the half-contract limit until the trailing stop is cleared, maintaining a 5:1 risk-reward ratio, and ensuring no drawdown exceeds 30% (or 50% if eligible) would be considered fully compliant under Apex rules.
*THIS PAGE HAS UPDATED DETAILED INFORMATION ON RECENT CLARIFICATIONS OF RULES*
Evaluations Accounts do not have a consistency rule. The evaluation assesses the capability to set profit goals and evaluate a trader's performance using an Evaluation (demo) account over a few days. The trader focuses on overcoming the "Trailing Drawdown," which they know is there and how it works. Take a few minutes to figure out how to adjust your trading and handle that curveball because markets will throw you curveballs all day...without a heads-up!
However, PA and Live Accounts have consistency rules, as explained below. You will understand the consistency rules by first reading what Apex Trader Funding wants and doesn’t want.
For PA and Live Funded Accounts:
As a relationship, Apex is searching for reputable traders who show their abilities to grow their accounts at a STEADY, building, compounding pace. 
Growing your account this way exemplifies the discipline of a consistent strategy that is traded ongoing day-to-day. It is not erratic trading with wild swings up and down or unrealistic profit amounts that are unrealistic in real-time markets.
Trader funding and paid performance are designed to be a long-term relationship.
Apex wants to fund and pay out traders who follow a consistent plan in size, stops, and targets. This means not trading the maximum or larger-than-usual contracts on one trade while trading micros for the rest of their time.
Apex doesn’t want traders who flip contracts just to show a trading day, constantly change sizes, or do high-frequency trading. Simply put, Apex wants Traders, not gamblers, scammers, schemers, or anyone looking to take advantage and work the system!
Contract Scaling Rule
To promote disciplined growth, the Contract Scaling rule outlines how traders manage contract sizes during the growth phase of the account.
Initial Limit: Traders are restricted to trading half of their maximum allowed contracts until they reach the trailing threshold stop.
Threshold Reached: Once the account's End-of-Day (EOD) balance exceeds the trailing threshold (the initial balance + trailing drawdown + $100), traders can then use their full contract limit starting with the next full trading session.
For example, on a $50,000 Performance Account (PA) with a maximum of 10 contracts, traders can initially trade up to 5 contracts. When the account EOD balance reaches $52,600 ($50,000 initial balance + $2,500 trailing drawdown + $100 buffer), the trailing stop no longer applies, and traders can trade the full 10 contracts.
Once the trailing threshold is reached, traders can continue using the full contract limit even if the account balance drops below the threshold.
Single Violation Penalty: If more than half of the maximum allowed contracts are accidentally traded, traders are expected to close out the excessive contracts immediately. Failure to do so may result in the payout request being denied and the account being reset to the EOD balance from the previous trading day, which is the day before the first scaling rule violation occurred. The trader would then need to complete 8 additional compliant trading days before becoming eligible to request another payout.
Consistent Violation Penalty: Blatant or repeated violations of the scaling rule will result in account closure and forfeiture of all balances.
30% Negative Profit and Loss Rule
The 30% Negative Profit and Loss (PnL) Rule limits the loss a trader can incur on any single trade, providing a structured approach to risk management. Under this rule, the live, unrealized, open negative PnL cannot exceed 30% of the account's profit balance at the start of the day on a per-trade basis.
This is not a daily loss limit but a control to prevent excessive loss on any individual trade. At any point, your combined open negative P&L should not surpass 30% of your start-of-day profit. Regularly monitor your trades and exposure to stay compliant with the rules.
For example, if a trader starts the day with a profit balance of $8,000 in a $150,000 account, the unrealized loss on any single trade cannot exceed $2,400. Losses can be distributed across multiple trades, provided no single trade breaches the 30% rule. Trades that violate this rule will not be canceled but will lead to a warning for the trader.
For new accounts or accounts with profits of less than the equivalent initial trailing drawdown amount, the 30% rule is based on the trailing threshold (e.g., 30% of $2,500 on a $50,000 account is $750).
Once you exit the safety net (i.e., the trailing threshold stops), the rule shifts to 30% of your start-of-the-day profit. If your account doubles its safety net, the allowed drawdown can increase to 50%.
If traders accidentally exceed the 30% limit, it does not immediately mean the account is in trouble. Traders should quickly manage trades and return within the acceptable risk zone. If the breach is minor and corrected promptly, there is no automatic penalty.
For instance, if your P&L drops to 32%, promptly closing or adjusting positions can prevent further issues. Minor, accidental breaches corrected in a timely manner will not lead to penalties.
These terms should be strictly followed, ensuring consistent compliance with Apex's 30% risk management guideline. The first violation of this rule will result in a written warning and possible review of the trader’s account. Blatant or repeated violations of this rule can lead to forfeiture of payout eligibility, removal of profits gained because of the violation of the rule, and the account may be closed permanently.
30% Consistency
The 30% profit guideline is designed to help traders maintain consistency in their trading activities with a focus on sustainable growth, as well as discourage erratic, windfall, high-risk, or all-in trading styles driven by a shortsighted goal of only quickly reaching a withdrawal point.
If the PA Account generates more than 30% of the total profit in a single trading day, there will be restrictions on profit withdrawals. Traders must continue trading consistently until the 30% profit balance is reduced.
A single violation of the 30% rule will require the trader to continue trading until the profits from the violating day represent less than 30% of the total balance. Blatant or repeated violations will result in the forfeiture of payout requests and possible account suspension.
(Note: The Company reviews this 30% rule from approval to approval and may choose to approve or require the profit balance to be above the 30% rule parameters and deny a payout.)
Once you reach your sixth payout, or are transferred to a Live Prop Trading Account, the 30% rule is no longer in effect.
Max Contracts
The trader shall not attempt to abuse the max contracts rule.
Examples include:
Trading combined instruments to do maximum contracts multiple times, such as 10 on ES and 10 on YM
Trading 20 contracts on a 10-contract maximum
Using micro contracts in this attempt
Any violation of this max contracts rule will result in the disqualification of the current payout request, and any gains from resulting trades will be removed. The account balance will be adjusted to reflect the account's status prior to the violation. Blatant or repeated abuse of this shall cause termination of the account with no refund or payout. 
Contract Size Consistency
These rules clearly require consistency of contract size. While this rule doesn't specify identical contract sizes for every trade, it highlights the significance of maintaining consistent overall size and correlation across multiple trades and time.
While there could be valid reasons for adjusting trades or contract sizes, consistency in trading behavior is crucial. Inconsistent contract sizes may indicate erratic trading behavior.
Traders who use a systematic approach, avoiding gambling and large windfall attempts, should have no difficulty complying with these guidelines. Given the numerous possibilities, Apex will not address requests for clarification on every trading scenario. Instead, traders should understand and follow the spirit of these guidelines: Be a trader, not a gambler or schemer. This will address 99% of the questions. 
Please note the following:
Apex will disqualify traders who attempt to manipulate the system by using large contract sizes early on, followed by smaller sizes.
Apex will not accept questions or requests for feedback on every scenario of scale, size, situation, “what if,” or various systematic approaches. There is an unlimited number of scenarios!
Traders who begin by using a large contract size in a new PA Account to chase lucky trades, big gains, or to recover from losses and then decrease to smaller sizes will be disqualified.
Manipulating the system usually causes multiple "blown" PA accounts before reaching the desired windfall.
To prevent disqualification, a trader might need to maintain consistent trading for eight days with the same contracts, size, and targets as the initial trades to demonstrate profit stability and be eligible for a payout request.
To trade the account with a larger number of contacts, make a simulated balance increase, then decrease the contract size; just getting to withdrawal is not a qualified strategy and is grounds for forfeit and payout denial.
A growing balance warrants a steady increase in contact size as the account balance and “cushion amount grow.” That is normal. It makes sense that as the profit balance and cushion increase, so does the use of contracts. 
A growing balance does not warrant a decrease in size. This is not a valid strategy; it is a fear of losing profit before a withdrawal because of a lack of discipline in a strategy.
Now, if the trader starts off trading a larger size, does not make progress, and the account balance decreases because of losses, then this situation warrants the responsible and reasonable action of trading a smaller size.
When you withdraw and reduce the balance, it is smart to trade with smaller sizes.
Individuals who cycle through multiple PA Accounts, starting with substantial amounts only to lose it all and begin anew, or who plan to reach withdrawal time in hopes of a significant win are gamblers, not traders. Apex has no interest in funding this behavior.
Traders agree and understand that any style of trading like this is prohibited. They will forfeit and have their payout requests denied until they demonstrate consistency, or they could face Probation Status.
Traders must continue to trade an account in the same manner from the beginning until payout or modify it according to growth or loss, not vice versa.
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA)
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) refers to entering a trade with a directional bias, even as the market moves against the trader. As the market moves against the trade, the trader continues to enter more orders in the same direction as the original order.
Under this Agreement, you can use Dollar Cost Averaging with additional entries.
There are no restrictions on the contract size for additional entries, nor are there specific guidelines on determining entry points, timeframes, or distances from the original entry. However, traders must maintain responsible risk-to-reward ratios in their trades. DCA is acceptable as long as it stays within the boundaries of other consistency rules, such as not exceeding a 30% profit in a day or reaching a 30% negative PnL. DCA needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Adding Into Trades
 Traders may take initial entries according to their trading strategy or system rules and add to those trades as the market moves in their favor. For example, if the trader enters a long trade and the market moves positively, they may add additional long contracts. In PA Accounts, traders are allowed to scale into winning trades, and it is understood that they may use larger contract sizes in such cases. It is key that the trader follows a defined strategy with a directional bias instead of placing trades recklessly in hopes of a sudden windfall.
There is a clear distinction between adding to successful trades based on a strategy and entering large contract sizes at the outset in hopes of a market turnaround. Adding contracts to a profitable trade as part of a strategy is acceptable, but placing large trades without a strategy and simply hoping for a positive market move is prohibited.
News Trading
Under these guidelines, traders can engage in news trading to capitalize on significant market events that create rapid price movements. However, the trader must adhere to a key restriction: during a news event, the trader may take a position in only one direction, either long or short. Holding positions in both directions during a news event is prohibited.
This rule ensures that traders maintain discipline during volatile market conditions, preventing confusion and promoting focused decision-making. The program aims to support strategic trading based on market analysis, not attempts to hedge both sides of a news-driven breakout.
Participation in any groups or schemes will result in the complete closure of accounts and being banned from the Apex Trader Funding website for both parties.
Traders can engage in news trading as long as they do not violate any other consistency rules (i.e 30% profit in a day, 30% negative PnL, etc.).
News trading needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Automation
AI, Autobots, Algorithms, Fully Automated Trading Systems or Software, High-Frequency Trading (HFTs), or any other automated trading is prohibited on the PA or Live accounts.
It is strictly prohibited to use any type of hands-off, set-and-forget, set-and-walk-away, trading continuously 24 hours a day, or any other type of automation, including those listed above. Using those types of automation will cause the closure of the PA or Live account and forfeiture of all funds and balances.
The use of semi-automated software must accompany full trader monitoring and presence at all times. This means the trader must be present, watching the trades and managing the entries and settings on the semi-automated software. This software assists in placing a trade based on a set of rules that the trader is actively monitoring, adjusting the software for market moves, longs, shorts, pausing, news awareness, market conditions, etc.
It is advisable to turn off and on semi-automated trading or a trade assistant as market conditions begin to set up for a trade or as they deteriorate. Remember, it is to be used to help with the speed or accuracy of placing a trade, not as a system that trades for you.
Hedging and Correlated Instruments
Traders shall not trade one direction on minis and another direction on micros at the same time. Traders shall not spread trade indices, i.e., long ES, and short YM. All Apex accounts must be traded directionally only and never be both long and short concurrently in the same account or in other accounts in any correlated markets. This includes all indices, metals, grains, or any correlating instrument, no matter the size, i.e., micro, mini, etc. For example, the trader cannot be short NQ and Long ES under any circumstance.
Copy or Trading Services Operations or Participations
 PA and Live Prop Accounts must be traded by the actual individual listed on the account and not by any other party, person, system, automated trading bot, copy, or trade mirror service. Failure to do so will result in an immediate breach of contract and closure of all accounts. 
Defined System with Set Rules
Traders must have a defined strategy or system with set rules for entries, stops, targets, and trailing. They will follow their rules consistently and with discipline. Traders will use a normal day-to-day system that is set, tracked, and explainable upon request.
Purposely and irresponsibly blowing multiple company accounts in an attempt for a “lottery-style lucky windfall” is not the purpose or the intent of Apex Trader Funding. Think about it as if you were funding a trader. Would you be comfortable with your funds being handled by a trader who is inconsistent and has a history of blowing through accounts? That trader is not the type you would trust.
Apex has the authority to request a detailed account of the trading strategy or system used and to review marked-up charts of trades chosen by Apex as evidence of consistent adherence to trading rules. Apex reserves the right to request a live Zoom session to observe and confirm compliance in a trading session. 
Apex has the option to ask for recordings of trading sessions demonstrating and explaining entries. Through these recorded sessions, Apex will review your trading system to assess your trading consistency and adherence to your system's rules. Apex will require documentation detailing the tools, indicators, platforms, and contract amounts utilized during the trading days.
Only directional strategies with bias and explanation aligned with a consistent strategy are approved. Traders cannot execute bracket orders in both directions without a directional bias.
You are not allowed to place a long limit order and a short limit order in anticipation of a market breakout for profit. This is the exact opposite of disciplined and consistent trading of a set system. This is often a sign that the trader does NOT have a system. In an attempt to catch a big break, they are working the system with no predetermined direction, bias, or entry rules.
Any trading strategy that involves chasing market movements and seeking windfall profits without a systematic approach is prohibited. The PA Consistency section and video series on the FAQ section of the Apex Trader Funding website state that any funds earned during forbidden periods or transactions will be deducted from the account.
Risk Management, Stop Losses, Profit Targets, Trailing
The Company's "risk capital" scenario provides an excellent opportunity to form a Trader Funding relationship with Apex. However, people often misuse and abuse this scenario, using it to “blow” through risk capital, transferring all risk and loss to the Company while trying to set up windfall payouts for schemers. The Company cannot permit this scenario for a potential transition to a Live Funded Account.
It is prohibited to trade without a stop and to let the Trailing Threshold limit “blow the account” strategy. Taking advantage of Company sales or promos to stockpile discounted backup evaluation accounts is also not allowed. This strategy will not result in funding or payouts but in a forfeiture.
Every successful trader or system incorporates stop losses. Stop, target, or trailing strategies, along with risk management rules, are mandatory for all Prop Firms. Upon entering a trade, every true system or strategy, especially scalping strategies, has a set amount as an initial stop loss.
For example, the trader targets a 10-tick scalp profit target with an initial stop of 30 ticks. This means risking 30 ticks to make 10 ticks. Alternatively, the trader is shooting for 20 ticks in profit with a stop loss of 60 ticks. In this scenario, the trader is risking three times the profit they are targeting.
PROPER RISK MANAGEMENT involves avoiding going all in with a maximum contract in hopes of a windfall without following system and stop rules. Or, at the start of a PA account, going in big with a large contract for a windfall " big pop" to overcome the trailing drawdown, then downsize and work the way to a payout. This is a windfall and gamble strategy and can lead to blowing an account. This is a withdrawal strategy, not a trading strategy. 
Risk management involves setting a stop loss and honoring it, exiting the trade, and protecting the account.  
With trending or longer-term strategies, the exact target is not always known. The market could go ten ticks or ten points. This is why having an initial stop loss is crucial - it sets the amount you're willing to risk to determine potential gains.
It's always a good idea to trail your stops/exit points when the market is moving in your favor and experiencing a significant trend. Allow your profits to increase, but remember to adjust your stops to prevent losing everything. This is good risk management!
The program requires traders to demonstrate consistent profitability over eight (8) trading days as part of the evaluation process. During this eight-day period, traders need to make a profit of at least $50 on five (5) different trading days to demonstrate their skills in trade management and consistent positive performance. The strategy allows flexibility, including the practice of "flipping," which allows traders to close and re-enter positions to adjust to market conditions. As long as you fulfill the $50 minimum for five (5) days, flipping is permitted. 
Required:
Implement risk management that suits the statistics and historical back-tested data of your strategy or system's profitability.
Plan your exit strategy for losses and profits before initiating the trade. It's important to have a PLAN, a SYSTEM, and RISK-TO-REWARD RATIOS in place that are statistically proven to be effective!
Risk-to-Reward Ratios
The program mandates a maximum risk-to-reward ratio of 5:1, so the stop loss should be set at 50 ticks for every 10 ticks of profit targeted. Although mental stops are permitted, the Company requires traders to practice responsible risk management and avoid risking substantially more than the potential reward. Violations of this rule may result in a warning, probation, or disqualification from payouts.
For example, if your target is to make $100 in profit, then do not risk more than $500 as your initial stop loss.
Honor your stop points. Avoid adjusting them in a way that could exceed your planned risk. You can always move stops forward to trail and protect profits, trail profits, and let profits run, but do not move them backward and risk more. Have a systematic plan and stick to it. Don't gamble or take risks in anticipation of a comeback.
ATM strategies allow you to set stop-loss and take-profit levels at the beginning of a trade and then alter them to trail and safeguard the trade. (Or they are programmed within the ATM Strategy to do so.)
Traders can manually set stops and take profits after entering a trade, then adjust and raise them as needed.
Stops and take profit levels can be "mentally planned/known levels." This means you are NOT required to enter the limit order stops or profit targets on your chart. This is not a requirement , unless you are on a Probation status.
Mental Stops: You know your system or strategy, know how to read the market and know how you would manage the trade ahead of time, before an entry. You are ready to manage it!
A trader knows the entry point, the exit point, the profit target, and where to start trailing, and is prepared to manage with discipline.
Prohibited Activities
The following trading behaviors and activities are strictly prohibited in Apex Trader Funding PA Accounts:
Trading without stop losses or risk management in place.
Engaging in high-risk strategies that aim for small profits while risking large amounts. An example is having a five-tick profit target with a 150-tick stop loss.
Using the full Apex Trader Funding account threshold as a stop loss to absorb large losses leading to account liquidation.
Stockpiling discounted evaluation accounts to cycle through and blow up accounts in pursuit of windfall profits.
Any trading, risk management strategy, scam, scheme, or implementation that fails to demonstrate sustained growth and consistency for all involved.
Utilizing trading and risk management techniques that deviate from what you would use in your personal funded account at a Registered Broker.
These activities do not show the disciplined, consistent approach Apex seeks to fund. Any trader engaging in these behaviors will forfeit their account and all associated balances.
Sharing MAC Addresses, Computers, IPs, Credit Cards, or Trade Copies will result in Account Closure and forfeiture. Should this occur, Apex could ask the user to undergo more audits and verification procedures to guarantee that only the authorized user is trading or accessing the account and to ensure adherence to the contract.
Company Code of Conduct
Traders commit to abiding by the Company Code of Conduct and treating all individuals with respect and professionalism. This means behaving professionally and positively in all situations, whether in groups, on social media, in trading rooms, or in any other setting.
Summary of Core Trading Rules
Use a Genuine Trading Strategy:
Traders must employ a consistent, real-world trading strategy that aligns with live market conditions.  
DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is Allowed:
Traders can use DCA as part of their strategy, provided they apply it consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
DCA is allowed as long as it doesn't break any other consistency rules (e.g., achieving 30% profit in a day, having a 30% negative PnL, etc.). 
Flipping is Allowed:
Rapidly opening and closing trades is acceptable to meet the requirement for a trading day, as long as the $50 minimum profit for five days is achieved. 
News Trading is Allowed (with Restrictions):
Trading based on news events is permitted; however, traders cannot take opposing positions (e.g., long and short) on the same news event.
Trading based on news is allowed, provided it does not break any other consistency guidelines (such as making a 30% profit in a day or having a 30% negative PnL). News trading needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Trade Half Contracts Until Trailing Stop is Achieved:
Traders are restricted to trading half of the available contracts until they hit the trailing stop threshold, which promotes careful risk management.
Maintain a 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio on Trades:
Ensure a maximum 5:1 risk-to-reward ratio on all trades. For instance, if targeting a profit of 10 ticks, the stop loss should not exceed 50 ticks.
Observe the 30% Drawdown Limit (Adjustable to 50%):
Maintain a 30% drawdown limit based on the account’s profit balance. As the account grows, this limit may be adjusted to 50%, providing more flexibility as the account becomes more established.
Practical Example:
A trader adheres to a defined, consistent strategy, observing the half-contract limit until the trailing stop is cleared. They maintain a 5:1 risk-reward ratio, and ensure no drawdown exceeds 30% (or 50% if eligible). Under Apex rules, this trader is classified as fully compliant.
